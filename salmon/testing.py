"""
A bag of generally useful things when writing unit tests for your Salmon
server.  The most important thing  using the TestConversation vs.
RouterConversation to talk to your server.

The TestConversation will use the salmon.server.Relay you have configured to
talk to your actual running Salmon server.  Since by default Salmon reloads
each file you change it will work to run your tests.

However, this isn't that fast, doesn't give you coverage analysis, and doesn't
let you test the results.  For that you use RouterConversation to do the exact
same API (they should be interchangeable) but rather than talk to a running
server through the relay, it just runs all the messages through the router
directly.

This is faster and will give you code coverage as well as make sure that all
the modules (not just your handlers) will get reloaded.
